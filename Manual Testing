Q1. What is Software Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Software testing is checking if the application works as expected and finding defects before it goes live.

Q2. What is the difference between Verification and Validation?
ðŸ‘‰ Verification â€“ Are we building the product right? (checking documents, design, code)
ðŸ‘‰ Validation â€“ Are we building the right product? (checking actual application with testing).

Q3. What is the difference between Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Smoke Testing â€“ Basic check to see if the build is stable.
ðŸ‘‰ Sanity Testing â€“ After changes/fixes, check if specific functionality works.

Q4. What is Regression Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Testing old functionality again after changes, to ensure nothing is broken.

Q5. What is the difference between Test Case and Test Scenario?
ðŸ‘‰ Test Case â€“ Step-by-step instructions with input, expected output.
ðŸ‘‰ Test Scenario â€“ High-level idea of what to test.

Q6. What are the different levels of testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Unit Testing â†’ Integration Testing â†’ System Testing â†’ UAT (User Acceptance Testing).

Q7. What is the difference between Severity and Priority?
ðŸ‘‰ Severity â€“ How serious the defect is.
ðŸ‘‰ Priority â€“ How fast it should be fixed.

Example: Login button not working = High Severity + High Priority.

Q8. What is Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)?
ðŸ‘‰ Testing at the edge values.
Example: If input is 1â€“100, test with 0, 1, 100, 101.

Q9. What is Equivalence Partitioning?
ðŸ‘‰ Divide input into valid and invalid groups.
Example: Age 18â€“60 â†’ Test with 20 (valid), 10 (invalid), 70 (invalid).

Q10. What are Common Testing Types?
ðŸ‘‰ Functional Testing, Non-Functional Testing (Performance, Security, Usability), Black Box, White Box, Regression, Retesting.

Q11. What is the Bug Life Cycle (Defect Life Cycle)?
ðŸ‘‰ New â†’ Assigned â†’ Open â†’ Fixed â†’ Retest â†’ Closed â†’ Reopen (if issue still exists).

Q12. What is Retesting vs Regression Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Retesting â€“ Testing the same bug again after itâ€™s fixed.
ðŸ‘‰ Regression â€“ Testing the entire system to check old features still work.

Q13. What is a Test Plan?
ðŸ‘‰ A document that describes what to test, how to test, who will test, and what tools/resources are needed.

Q14. What is a Test Case? Can you give an example?
ðŸ‘‰ A Test Case is a set of steps with input, expected output, and actual output.
ðŸ“Œ Example: Login Page Test

Step: Enter valid username & password â†’ Click Login

Expected: User should land on Home page.

Q15. What is Exploratory Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Testing without test cases, just exploring the app to find defects using domain knowledge.

Q16. What is Ad-hoc Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Random testing without following any process or documentation.

Q17. What is the difference between Functional and Non-Functional Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Functional â€“ Check features (login, search, payment).
ðŸ‘‰ Non-Functional â€“ Check performance, speed, security, usability.

Q18. What is Defect Severity vs Priority with Example?
ðŸ‘‰ Severity â€“ How much it impacts functionality.
ðŸ‘‰ Priority â€“ How quickly it should be fixed.
ðŸ“Œ Example:

Wrong spelling in About Page = Low Severity + Low Priority.

Login not working = High Severity + High Priority.

Q19. What is End-to-End Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Testing the entire flow of the application.
ðŸ“Œ Example: E-commerce â†’ Login â†’ Search â†’ Add to Cart â†’ Payment â†’ Logout.

Q20. What is the difference between Static Testing and Dynamic Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Static â€“ Testing without running code (reviews, walkthroughs).
ðŸ‘‰ Dynamic â€“ Testing by executing the application.

Q21. What is the difference between Positive and Negative Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Positive Testing â€“ Test with valid inputs (expected behavior).
ðŸ‘‰ Negative Testing â€“ Test with invalid inputs (system should handle error).

Q22. What are Common Documents in Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Test Plan, Test Case, Test Scenario, RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix), Bug Report.

Q23. What is RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix)?
ðŸ‘‰ A document that maps requirements â†’ test cases, to ensure all requirements are covered.

Q24. What is Sanity vs Regression Testing?
ðŸ‘‰ Sanity â€“ Small check after a fix, focusing only on related functionality.
ðŸ‘‰ Regression â€“ Checking the whole system after changes.

Q25. What are Common Bug Tracking Tools?
ðŸ‘‰ JIRA, Bugzilla, HP ALM, Mantis, Trello.
