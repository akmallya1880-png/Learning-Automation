1. Base Class (Foundation Layer)

This class contains common setup and teardown methods used across all tests.

Typical contents:

WebDriver initialization (e.g., launching Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Browser configurations (timeouts, window maximize, cookies, etc.).

NUnit annotations like 
Onetimesetup
Onetimeteardown

Utility integrations (screenshots, reports).

Why we use it: Avoids duplication since every test needs a browser setup and cleanup.

2. Page Object Methods (Page Object Model â€“ POM Layer)

Each webpage / module in the application is represented as a class.

Inside that class, we store:

Locators (By/Xpath/CSS) for elements.

Methods (actions) that interact with those elements

3. Test Cases (Test Layer)

The actual test scripts live here.

They call methods from Page Object classes to perform actions and verify results.

Test layer should only contain test steps and assertions, not locators.

Keeps tests clean, readable, and maintainable.
