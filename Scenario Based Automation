1) Functionality not fully developed — what will you do?
I will not block automation.
Approach:
Talk to developer/product owner to understand expected behavior
Create:
Test cases
Automation skeleton (empty methods)

Use mock data or stubs if available

Automate once UI is stable

Interview line:

I prepare test scenarios early and automate once functionality stabilizes to avoid rework.

✅ 2) If a test fails — next step?

Step by step:

Check failure screenshot/logs

Verify:

Locator changed?

Page load issue?

Data issue?

Re-run locally

Report bug if it’s an application issue

Golden rule:
❌ Don’t immediately fix script — first find root cause.

✅ 3) Minor application changes — how modify scripts?

✔ Use Page Object Model (POM)

So only:

Update locator in Page class

Not in 100 test cases

Example:
If button ID changes → update once in Page file.

Interview line:

With POM and reusable methods, maintenance is quick and minimal.

✅ 4) Automating Login functionality

Typical steps:

✔ Locate username
✔ Locate password
✔ Click login
✔ Validate dashboard/home page

Extra good practices:

Use explicit wait

Use config file for credentials

Assert successful login

✅ 5) Verify email after registration

Best approaches:

Option 1 (Best):

Use test email inbox API like:

Mailinator

Gmail API

Steps:

Register user

Open test inbox

Read latest mail

Validate subject/link/content

Interview tip:

We should avoid real email systems and use test email services.

✅ 6) Long execution scenario — manual or automation?

✔ Always Automation (if repetitive)

Because:

Saves time long term

Can run overnight (CI/CD)

Manual only if:

One-time test

UI constantly changing

✅ 7) Validate downloaded file content

Steps:

Click download button

Go to download folder

Verify:

File exists

File name

Open and validate content (Excel, PDF, CSV)

Example tools:

Java/C# File IO

Apache POI (Excel)

✅ 8) Verify color, font, position

Use CSS property validation:

Example:

Get element color

Get font-family

Get location (x,y)

Things to check:

element.getCssValue("color")

element.getCssValue("font-family")

element.getLocation()

✅ 9) Handle pop-ups & alerts
For browser alerts:
driver.switchTo().alert().accept();


or

dismiss()

For windows:

Get window handles

Switch to child window

Perform action

Switch back

✅ 10) Scroll till footer visible

Use JavaScriptExecutor:

js.executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);", footerElement);


Or:

window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)


Then verify footer displayed.

✅ 11) Automating legacy application

My approach:

✔ First check automation feasibility
✔ Identify stable elements
✔ Start with smoke scenarios
✔ Slowly increase coverage

If UI is unstable:

Use API testing where possible

Interview line:

I prioritize critical flows first and use hybrid automation where needed.

✅ 12) Script worked yesterday, fails today — troubleshoot

Checklist:

✅ App change?
✅ Locator change?
✅ Environment down?
✅ Test data expired?
✅ Sync issue (wait problem)?

Debug using:

Logs

Screenshots

Rerun locally

✅ 13) Automation running slow — how improve?

✔ Reduce unnecessary waits
✔ Use explicit wait not Thread.sleep
✔ Run tests in parallel
✔ Optimize browser setup
✔ Avoid redundant logins

Bonus: Use headless execution.

✅ 14) Script failing due to app change — what to do?

Identify what changed

Update locators in POM

Revalidate flow

Add better waits

Inform team about breaking change

Best practice:

Maintain automation like production code.
